# Pet Store API Testing Project

This repository contains a comprehensive testing suite for the Swagger Pet Store API, including both functional API testing and performance testing implementations. The project demonstrates best practices in API testing using modern tools and frameworks.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main components:

1. Functional API Automation Testing (`api-test-automation`)
2. Performance Testing (`api-test-performance`)

Both test projects target the [Swagger Pet Store](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore) API, which provides endpoints for managing pets, store orders, and users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Java 8 or higher
- Docker
- Git
- Maven

## Stack used in this project (main tools)

- Playwright `v1.49.0` (for API automation testing)
- Gatling  `3.13.103` (for performance Testing)
- Typescript as the programming language for both projects

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandervegazo26/pet-store-api-test.git
cd pet-store-api-test
```

2. Install dependencies for functional testing:

```bash
cd api-test-automation
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

3. Install dependencies for performance testing:

```bash
cd ../api-test-performance
npm install
```

4. Start the Pet Store application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore.git
cd swagger-petstore

docker build -t swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable .
docker pull swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
docker run  --name swaggerapi-petstore3 -d -p 8080:8080 swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
```

## Configuration

### Functional Testing Configuration

The functional tests use Playwright's configuration file (`playwright.config.ts`) which can be found in the `api-test-automation` directory. Key configurations include:

- Test timeouts
- Retry attempts
- Reporter settings
- Base URL configuration

### Performance Testing Configuration

Performance tests are configured through environment variables in the `.env` file:

```ini
# Pet simulation variables
PET_RAMP_DURATION=5
CREATE_PETS=10
READ_PETS=20

# Store simulation variables
ORDER_RAMP_DURATION=5
CREATE_ORDERS=10
READ_ORDERS=20
DELETE_ORDERS=5
READ_INVENTORY=15

# User simulation variables
USER_RAMP_DURATION=5
CREATE_USERS=10
READ_USERS=20
UPDATE_USERS=8
DELETE_USERS=5
AUTH_USERS=25
```

create an .env file under `./api-test-performance`

## Running Tests

### Running Functional Tests

From the `api-test-automation` directory:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test
```

```bash
# Run most critical tests, those we usually execute on an smoke test
npm run test:smoke
```

### Running Performance Tests

From the `api-test-performance` directory:

```bash
# Run all simulations
npm run all-simulations

# Run specific simulations
npm run pet-simulation
npm run store-simulation
npm run user-simulation
```

## CI/CD Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing:

### Functional Testing Workflow

- Automatically runs on push to main branch
- Executes all functional tests
- Generates and publishes test reports
- Available at: `https://alexandervegazo26.github.io/pet-store-api-test/api-test-automation/report/`

### Performance Testing Workflow

- Can be triggered manually or on push
- Executes performance simulations
- Generates and publishes performance reports
- Available at: `https://alexandervegazo26.github.io/pet-store-api-test/api-test-performance/`

### Manual Execution from Github actions

In `Actions` tab in github, you can manually run the workflows:

1.  `Functional Tests`
2.  `Performance Tests`

Once you click the workflow you want to execute manually, you can go to `Run Workflow` and click on the green button with the same name (`Run Workflow`).

## Functional Test Case Selection Reason

The test cases selected for this project represent the most critical paths and functionalities of the Pet Store API. Here's why these specific test cases are crucial:

### Core CRUD Operations Coverage

- Each entity (Pet, Store, User) has complete coverage of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- These operations form the backbone of the API's functionality and must work flawlessly
- Testing these ensures the basic data management capabilities are intact

### Business Logic Validation

- Pet Status Management: Testing pet status changes and filtering ensures the inventory system works correctly
- Order Processing: Verifies the complete order lifecycle from creation to fulfillment
- User Authentication: Covers the essential user management and security features

### Error Handling

- Invalid data scenarios are included for each entity
- Non-existent resource requests are tested
- These cases ensure the API fails gracefully and provides appropriate error messages

### Data Integrity

- Image upload functionality ensures multimedia handling works correctly
- Inventory checking verifies stock management accuracy
- Multiple user creation tests batch processing capabilities

### Security Considerations

- User authentication workflow is thoroughly tested
- Session management (login/logout) is verified
- Authorization requirements for protected endpoints are validated

These test cases were selected based on:

1. Impact on core business functionality
2. Frequency of endpoint usage
3. Complexity of operations
4. Potential for system failures
5. Security implications

By covering these aspects, we ensure the API's reliability, functionality, and security while maintaining efficient test coverage without unnecessary redundancy.

### Performance Test Scenarios

The project includes focused performance test scenarios for critical API operations:

#### Pet Endpoints Performance Tests

```typescript
createPetScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
updatePetScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
findPetsByStatusScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
```

#### Store Endpoints Performance Tests

```typescript
placeOrderScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
getOrderByIdScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
deleteOrderScenario(); // 100concurrent users
getInventoryScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
```

#### User Endpoints Performance Tests

```typescript
createUserScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
createUsersWithListScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
getUserByUsernameScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
updateUserScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
deleteUserScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
loginScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
logoutScenario(); // 100 concurrent users
```

### Performance Test Scenario Selection Rationale

These scenarios were chosen based on several key factors:

1. **High-Traffic Operations**

   - Pet search operations typically have the highest usage in pet store systems
   - Inventory checks are frequent operations in store management
   - User authentication is a constant background operation

2. **Resource-Intensive Operations**

   - Batch user creation tests system's ability to handle multiple simultaneous writes
   - Pet image uploads test binary data handling under load
   - Order placement tests complex transactions with multiple database operations

3. **Business-Critical Paths**

   - Authentication scenarios (login/logout) must remain responsive under load
   - Inventory management directly impacts business operations
   - Order processing represents revenue-generating transactions

4. **Data Consistency Operations**
   - Concurrent create/update/delete operations test data integrity
   - Multiple simultaneous reads test caching and database performance
   - Batch operations test system's bulk processing capabilities

Each scenario uses a 100-second ramp-up period with 100 concurrent users to provide:

- Realistic simulation of production load
- Sufficient stress to identify performance bottlenecks
- Consistent baseline for performance metrics
- Manageable test execution time
